# public-release
The only real flashing tool on Github and the internet. Coin Flashr is a USDT flashing software that also allows Bitcoin flashing. Available for Windows, Linux, Mac, android and IOS.

# Description
**What is USDT flashing?**
It usually refers to *making fake or temporary USDT balances appear in a wallet or transaction history* without actually sending real funds. These “flashed” tokens are not real transfers and *cannot be spent* — they only look like money was received.

# ❗ Understanding “USDT Flashing”

## 🚫 What people *claim* “USDT flashing” can do
- Show **fake incoming USDT** in someone’s wallet
- Send **unconfirmed or non-final transactions**
- Use **testnet or spoofed tokens** to pretend it’s real money

---

## ✅ What it actually is in reality
There is **no legitimate tool or method** to create real, spendable USDT out of thin air.

“USDT flashing” is almost always:
- wallet balance spoofing
- edited screenshots
- fake wallet or exchange apps
- testnet tokens passed off as real mainnet USDT
- unconfirmed transactions 

---

## ⚠️ Why you should be very careful
- commonly used in **fraud and advance-fee scams**
- victims are tricked into releasing goods or crypto
- may involve **serious legal consequences**
- most “USDT flash apps/software/APKs” are actually **malware or theft tools**

> If someone offers **“USDT flash software,” “flash that spends,” or “guaranteed confirmations,”** it is almost certainly a **scam targeting you**.

---

## 📚 If your goal is legitimate learning, here are safe topics
- how **USDT actually works** on TRON / ERC-20 networks  
- how **blockchain confirmations** and pending transactions work  
- how to **spot fake wallet screenshots or spoofed tokens**  
- how to **stay safe from crypto scams**  
- how **stablecoins maintain value**

### ✔ Summary
USDT flashing = **fake displays of money**, not real spendable funds.

# USDT flashing software
Coin Flashr is a USDT flashing software that lets users perform BTC and USDT flashing transactions with multiple variants of Bitcoin (including Bitcoin Fantom and Wrapped Bitcoin) and USDT (ERC20, BEP20, and TRC20). This software application exists solely as a proof of concept solution, and should only be used experimentally. The setup and utilization is entirely dummyproof. Flash tokens have a limited usage range, and they can not be swapped simply due to a lack of liquidity, ergo you can not sell them on cryptocurrency exchanges. That simply does not exist. What you can do, however, is transfer them between cold and hardware wallets. Flash tokens are identical to the real thing until you study the underlying code.

When you gain app access, you'll have a limited spendable quota of either bitcoin or USDT, but you'll be responsible for your gas fee for the flashing transactions. You'll find a gas address in-app and the gas topup process is simple.
